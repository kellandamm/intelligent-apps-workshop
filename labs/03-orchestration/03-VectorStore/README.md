# 03 - Vector Stores

In this folder you will find exercises showing how to work with different vector stores. We introduce concepts like Qdrant, Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB (vCore), and Azure AI Search which allow AI Orchestration to overcome the size limitation of prompts.

Below is a list of each of the labs in this section and what each one sets out to achieve.

## Qdrant

[Qdrant](qdrant.ipynb)

This lab uses a local instance of Qdrant to demonstrate how to work with a vector store.

## Azure AI Search

[Azure AI Search](aisearch.ipynb)

This lab will walk you through how to use Azure AI Search as a vector store and search ranking capabilities.

## Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB (vCore)

[Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB (vCore)](mongo.ipynb)

In this lab, you will see how you can use Azure CosmosDB as a vector store and as a semantic cache.
